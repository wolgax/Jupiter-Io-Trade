# Jupiter Io Trade

###### Inspired by [Jupiter one-click trade](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jupiter-one-click-trade/ikgjoamcghndkhllakdjhppmcogblemi) I decided to create another implementation of such a good idea.

Tired of ~1% fees? This extension will embed [Jupiter Plugin](https://plugin.jup.ag) with 2X lower fee (**0.5% fee**) inside your favorite terminal. Nothing else.
> [!NOTE]
> This is a learning project, and it can lead to financial costs if 
applied incorrectly. The 0.5% fee is divided between the creator and 
the Jupiter platform. You can explore the [web page bridge](https://github.com/wolgax/jupiter-io-web) without installing the extension.

> [!TIP]
> 1. Download the archive with the project. Click the green Code button â†’ Download ZIP
> 2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
> 3. Open Chrome Extension page. Click the three-dot menu â†’ Extensions â†’ Manage Extensions. 
> 4. Enable Developer mode. On the top-right of the Extensions page, toggle Developer mode to On.
> 5. Load the unpacked extension. Select the folder where you extracted the extension from the ZIP file.
