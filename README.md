# Jupiter Io Trade

###### Inspired by [Jupiter one-click trade](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jupiter-one-click-trade/ikgjoamcghndkhllakdjhppmcogblemi) I decided to create another implementation of such a good idea. 

<div align="left">

Tired of ~1% fees? This extension will embed [Jupiter Plugin](https://plugin.jup.ag) with 2X lower fee (**0.05% fee**) inside your favorite terminal. Nothing else.

Attention! This is a learning project, and it can lead to financial costs if applied incorrectly. The 0.05% fee is divided between the creator and the Jupiter platform.
